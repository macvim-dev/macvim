## Getting Started

See [installation documentation](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/wiki/Installing) for more details and alternative methods to install.

### Download

You can download the latest version of MacVim from the [Releases](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/releases/latest) page.

### Install via Package Manager

If you would like to install using a package manager, MacVim can be installed via Homebrew:

  ```zsh
  brew install macvim
  ```

MacVim is also available as a Homebrew cask. It will install the same pre-built binary as the one available from GitHub release:

  ```zsh
  brew install --cask macvim-app
  ```

After installation, MacVim can be launched using the Dock or in the terminal using the `mvim` command.

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build MacVim from source, detailed instructions are provided in the [Building MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/wiki/Building) guide.

## Relationship with Vim

MacVim is a downstream fork of Vim, and routinely [merges from upstream](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/wiki/Merging-from-upstream-Vim). The original Vim README can be found at [README_vim.md](README_vim.md). Vim itself is also available for macOS, but it does not have a GUI.

In Homebrew, there are both a `macvim` and `vim` package. Both packages will provide a terminal version of Vim with similar features. The `vim` package is from the upstream Vim project and is usually a bit more up-to-date in core Vim features, while the `macvim` package will provide the additional GUI version bundled as an app.

## License

MacVim is released under the [Vim License](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/blob/master/LICENSE).
