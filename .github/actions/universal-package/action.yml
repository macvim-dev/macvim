description: Create universal Homebrew package which contains x86_64 and arm64

# Instead of using the default binary installed by Homebrew, we need to build our own because third-party libraries are
# statically linked in MacVim, and need to be built against MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to ensure the built binary will
# work on supported macOS versions. Another reason for building our own custom package is to build a unviersal binary
# that has both x86_64 and arm64 arch, as Homebrew's distributed bottles are thin binaries with only one arch.
#
# We still use Homebrew to manage the library because their formulas are up to date and have correct build instructions
# that will work. This way we don't have to manually configuring and building and updating the package info.
