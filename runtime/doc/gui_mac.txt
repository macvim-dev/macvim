==============================================================================
1. MacVim differences					*macvim-differences*

One of the goals of MacVim is to make Vim behave like a proper macOS
application.  For this reason MacVim behaves slightly different from other GUI
ports of Vim.  Most of the modifications are provided in the system gvimrc
file; you can quickly open this file and look at it yourself by typing: >
	:tabe $VIM/gvimrc
Note that this file will be overwritten each time you update MacVim, so it is
best to keep your own modifications inside "~/.gvimrc".

							*macvim-windows*
There is some confusion regarding the term "window" in MacVim since it means
one thing to Vim and another to MacVim.  A "window" in Vim is what opens up
when you type ":sp", whereas a "window" in MacVim is the GUI window which
contains the text view, scrollbars, toolbar and tabline.  To avoid confusion,
the former is referred to as a Vim-window, whereas the latter is simply called
a window.

							*macvim-encoding*
It is not possible to modify 'termencoding' in MacVim; this option is forcibly
set to "utf-8".  The option 'encoding' also defaults to "utf-8" (as opposed to
"latin1" in the other GUI ports).

In generally you should keep 'encoding' set to the default ("utf-8") as that's
what macOS uses.  It also works on any character.  Sometimes you may need to
set 'fileencodings' to auto-detect encoding of files you edit, or force the
detection with |++enc| on the command line.

However, if you are editing files that use multiple encodings (container
formats like MIME or Unix mbox files) or a binary file, you want to make sure
'binary' is set (see |edit-binary|).

							*macvim-shift-movement*
Text editors on macOS lets the user hold down shift+movement key to extend the
selection.  Also, pressing a printable key whilst selecting replaces the
current selection with that character.  MacVim can emulate this kind of
behaviour (by providing key bindings and by setting 'keymodel' and
'selectmode' to non-default values) although it is not enabled by default.  To
make MacVim behave more like TextEdit and less like Vim, add the following
lines to your "~/.vimrc" (not .gvimrc) file: >
	if has("gui_macvim")
	  let macvim_hig_shift_movement = 1
	endif
<
							*macvim-drag-n-drop*
Dragging files and dropping them on a window opens those files in tabs in that
window, unless Vim is in command-line mode.  In command-line mode the names of
the files are added to the command line.  Holding down modifier keys whilst
dragging is not supported.

If a file is dropped on the Dock icon, it is always opened in a new tab
regardless of the mode Vim is currently in.  The same holds if you
double-click on a file in the Finder.

The "Open files from applications" setting in the General settings pane
gives more options on how dropped files should open, in case tabs are not
desired.

				    *macvim-default-menus* *macvim-help-menu*
The default menus (|menu.vim|) in MacVim have been changed to conform better
with the Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).

The Help menu's search can be used to search Vim's documentation.  You can use
it to quickly find the documentation you want in addition to using |:help|.

							*macvim-window-title*
The default window title does not include the argument list because it looks
really bad once you start using tabs.  For example, dropping two files, then
dropping two more, and switching back to the first tab would cause weird
strings like "((3) of 2)" to appear in the window title.

							*macvim-tablabel*
By default, tab labels only show the tail of the file name to make the tabs
more readable when editing files in deeply nested folders.  Add the line "set
guitablabel=" to your .gvimrc file to revert back to the default Vim tab
label.  Setting 'guitablabel' to anything in your .vimrc will also prevent
this default from taking effect.

							*E9000-M*
Below is a list of non-standard Vim commands and options that MacVim supports.
They are only usable when GUI is active.

							*macvim-options*
These are the non-standard options that MacVim supports:
	'antialias'	'blurradius'	'fullscreen'
	'fuoptions'	'macligatures'	'macmeta'	'macthinstrokes'
	'toolbariconsize'	'transparency'

These are GUI-related Vim options that have MacVim-specific behaviors:
	'guifont'

							*macvim-commands*
These are the non-standard commands that MacVim supports:
	|:macaction|	|:macmenu|

						*macvim-builtin-functions*
These are the non-standard builtin functions that MacVim supports:
	|showdefinition()|

                                                       *macvim-autocommands*
These are the non-standard events that MacVim supports:
	|OSAppearanceChanged|

					       *macvim-internal-variables*
These are the non-standard internal variables that MacVim supports:
	|v:os_appearance|

							*macvim-find*
Whenever you search for something in Vim (e.g. using "/"), or hit <D-e> when
you have text selected, the search query is copied to the macOS "Find
Pasteboard".  The idea is that if you search for something and switch to
another application, then you can hit <D-g> (or <D-G>) to repeat the search in
the new app.  The same feature works if you search in some app, switch to
MacVim and hit <D-g>.

If you would like to turn off sharing Vim's search query to the macOS Find
Pasteboard, you can set |MMShareFindPboard| to "NO". Even when that's set,
<D-g> will still use the OS Find Pasteboard for searching (use |n| instead if
that's not what you want), and <D-e> ("Edit -> Use Selection for Find") will
still share the search pattern to Find Pasteboard.

Note that the command |n| is not the same as <D-g>.  The former will repeat
the last search made in Vim, whereas the latter searches for the string on the
macOS Find Pasteboard using the action findNext: (see |:macaction|).

The <D-g> key equivalent is a great way to bring a search from one window to
another in MacVim.  Simply search for something in one window (using "/") then
switch to another (e.g. with <D-`>) and hit <D-g> and the search will be
repeated in the new window.

					*macvim-backspace* *macvim-delete*
The 'backspace' option is set in the system vimrc to make the delete key
behave in a more familiar way to new users.  If you dislike this non-default
behaviour, then add the line "set backspace&" to your "~/.vimrc" file.

==============================================================================
2. Starting MacVim					*macvim-start*

Starting MacVim from the UI ~

To start MacVim in macOS, simply double-click its icon in the Finder or click
on the Dock icon. Usually it should be installed as
`/Applications/MacVim.app`.

MacVim automatically registers itself as an editor of several standard file
formats.  This enables you to double-click a file to open it with MacVim (if
it is not associated with another program), or to right-click a file to bring
up the "Open with" menu.  You can also drag and drop files onto the Dock icon
to open them in tabs in a new window, or you can drop them in an already open
window to open the files in tabs in that specific window (it is possible to
have files open in e.g. splits by changing the "Open files from applications"
option in the General settings pane).  Finally, you can use macOS System
Services to open files in MacVim, see |macvim-services|.

Alternatively, use the "open" command (this method can not be used to pass
parameters to Vim) >
	open -a MacVim file ...
The advantage of using the latter method is that the settings relating to file
opening in the settings panel are respected, and files open instantly if
|Quickstart| is enabled.

Starting MacVim from a terminal ~

						    *mvim* *macvim-cmdline*
MacVim comes bundled with a shell script called "mvim" that can be used to
launch MacVim from the terminal. It's located at: >
	/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/bin/mvim
<
							*macvim-PATH*
To be able to easily use it, put this folder in your path: >
	/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/bin
For example, if you use zsh, you can put the following in `~/.zprofile`: >
	export PATH="/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/bin:$PATH"
<
After that, type "mvim" to start MacVim from Terminal. >
	$ mvim
You can also specify files to open with. >
	$ mvim file ...
The bin folder also contains `mvimdiff` and `mview` that work as alias of
|gvimdiff| and |gview|, as well as `xxd` for |hex-editing|.

You can still use the normal "vim", "vimdiff", and "view" commands if you want
to use non-GUI Vim, and "gvim" to launch MacVim ("gvim" works the same way as
"mvim").

If you would like to have man pages with the command-line tools, you can add
the following to `~/.zprofile`: >
	export MANPATH="/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/man:$MANPATH"
<
Going from terminal to GUI mode ~

Once in terminal Vim it is possible to start the MacVim GUI by using the
following command (see |:gui|): >
	:gui [++opt] [+cmd] [-f|-b] [files...]
Note: Forking ("-b") currently does not work.

							*Quickstart*
Quickstart ensures that new windows open quickly e.g. when <D-n> is
pressed.  It works by keeping a Vim process in the background that will
immediately become active when you open a window.  This feature can be enabled
from the Advanced settings pane (it is disabled by default).  Note that
this setting does not affect the speed with which windows open when using the
|mvim| command.

Note that any changes to runtime files that are kept in a non-standard
location (i.e. not in ~/.vim) will not be picked up for the first window that
opens after any changes.  Also, there are some issues related to reading and
writing of the |viminfo| file which can lead to the command line history
appearing to be lost (as well as any other information stored in the |viminfo|
file).  For example, if you open a window, edit some files then close the
window, then the next window that opens will not have the same command line
history as the window you just closed (however the next window you open will).
For these reasons Quickstart is disabled by default.

						*odbeditor* *external-editor*
MacVim can act as an "external editor" for macOS applications that support the
ODB Editor Protocol (or the "external editor" protocol).  Each application has
different ways of configuring this option, check the application's
documentation.  Once configured properly MacVim can be used to open files in
such an application.

A technical note: MacVim handles file open, modified and closed events.  In
the open event the FTok and Burl parameters are parsed (the latter is ignored
at the moment though).  In the modified and closed events the Tokn parameter
is sent back to the server application.

The ODB editor protocol is documented at:
	https://www.barebones.com/support/develop/odbsuite.html

==============================================================================
3. Settings		    *macvim-prefs* *macvim-preferences* *macvim-settings*

Some settings are global to the MacVim application and would not make sense as
Vim options (see |macvim-options|).  These settings are stored in the user
defaults database and can be accessed via the "MacVim.Settings…"
("MacVim.Preferences…" in macOS 12 Monterey and older) menu item.

If you want to open MacVim with its default settings, you can open it by
passing `-IgnoreUserDefaults 1` to the launch arguments (see the man page on
the "open" for how to do so).

							*macvim-user-defaults*
Not all entries in the user defaults database are exposed via the settings
panel, usually because they should not be changed by the user under normal
circumstances.  These options can still be changed with the "defaults" command
by opening Terminal and typing >
	defaults write org.vim.MacVim KEY VALUE
Check the man page on "defaults" for more information on this command as well
as general information regarding macOS user defaults.

Here is a list of relevant dictionary entries:

KEY				VALUE ~
*MMAllowForceClickLookUp*	use Force click for data lookup instead of
				<ForceClick> [bool]
*MMCellWidthMultiplier*		width of a normal glyph in em units [float]
*MMCmdLineAlignBottom*		Pin command-line to bottom of MacVim [bool]
*MMDialogsTrackPwd*		open/save dialogs track the Vim pwd [bool]
*MMDisableLaunchAnimation*	disable launch animation when opening a new
				MacVim window [bool]
*MMFontPreserveLineSpacing*	use the line-spacing as specified by font [bool]
*MMLoginShell*			use login shell for launching Vim [bool]
*MMLoginShellArgument*		login shell parameter [string]
*MMLoginShellCommand*		which shell to use to launch Vim [string]
*MMFullScreenFadeTime*		fade delay for non-native fullscreen [float]
*MMNativeFullScreen*		use native full screen mode [bool]
*MMNonNativeFullScreenShowMenu*	show menus when in non-native full screen [bool]
*MMNonNativeFullScreenSafeAreaBehavior*
				behavior for non-native full sreen regarding
				the safe area (aka the "notch") [int]
*MMNoFontSubstitution*		disable automatic font substitution [bool]
				(Deprecated: Non-CoreText renderer only)
*MMNoTitleBarWindow*		hide title bar [bool]
*MMTitlebarAppearsTransparent*	enable a transparent titlebar [bool]
*MMAppearanceModeSelection*	dark mode selection (|macvim-dark-mode|)[bool]
*MMRendererClipToRow*		clip tall characters to the row they are on [bool]
*MMScrollOneDirectionOnly*	scroll along one axis only when using trackpad [bool]
*MMSmoothResize*		allow smooth resizing of MacVim window [bool]
*MMShareFindPboard*		share search text to Find Pasteboard [bool]
*MMShowAddTabButton*		enable "add tab" button on tabline [bool]
*MMTabMaxWidth*			maximum width of a tab [int]
*MMTabMinWidth*			minimum width of a tab [int]
*MMTabOptimumWidth*		default width of a tab [int]
*MMTextInsetBottom*		text area offset in pixels [int]
*MMTextInsetLeft*		text area offset in pixels [int]
*MMTextInsetRight*		text area offset in pixels [int]
*MMTextInsetTop*		text area offset in pixels [int]
*MMTexturedWindow*		use brushed metal window (Tiger only) [bool]
*MMTranslateCtrlClick*		interpret ctrl-click as right-click [bool]
*MMUseMouseTime*		use mousetime to detect multiple clicks [bool]
*MMVerticalSplit*		files open in vertical splits [bool]
*MMZoomBoth*			zoom button maximizes both directions [bool]
*MMUpdaterPrereleaseChannel*	opt-in to pre-release software update [bool]
*MMShowWhatsNewOnStartup*	show "What's New" after updating to new version [bool]

As an example, if you have more than one mouse button and would wish to free
up Ctrl-click so you can bind it to something else, then the appropriate
command is: >
	defaults write org.vim.MacVim MMTranslateCtrlClick 0
<
If you wish to restore all user defaults to their starting values, open
Terminal and type: >
	defaults delete org.vim.MacVim
<
							*macvim-login-shell*
Applications opened from the Finder do not automatically source the user's
environment variables (which are typically set in .profile or .bashrc).  This
presents a problem when using |:!| to execute commands in the shell since e.g.
$PATH might not be set properly.  To work around this problem MacVim starts
new Vim processes via a login shell so that all environment variables are set.

By default MacVim uses the $SHELL environment variable to determine which
shell to use (if $SHELL is not set "/bin/bash" is used).  It is possible to
override this choice by setting the user default |MMLoginShellCommand| to the
shell that should be used (e.g. "/bin/tcsh").  MacVim tries to make the shell
a login shell by prepending argv[0] with a dash.  If you use an exotic shell
and need to pass it a parameter to make it a login shell then you can set the
user default |MMLoginShellArgument| (e.g. to "-l").  Finally, if the "bash"
shell is used, then "-l" is automatically added as an argument.  To override
this behaviour set |MMLoginShellArgument| to "--".

To turn off using a login shell, you can set |MMLoginShell| to 0.

==============================================================================
4. MacVim appearance					*macvim-appearance*

For more configuration options, see the Settings… → Appearance pane.

				*macvim-appearance-mode* *macvim-dark-mode*
MacVim will by default use the system apperance mode (light or dark). However,
you can manually force MacVim to use either light or dark mode in the
settings panel. A fourth option allows MacVim to respect the |'background'|
option set by Vim, which is more flexible in situations like loading a dark
color scheme while system settings are configured to use light mode. It's
also the recommended setting when title bar is configured to be "Transparent"
(see |MMTitlebarAppearsTransparent|).

If you would like to query the system apperance mode in Vim (e.g. to change
the color scheme at launch), see |v:os_appearance|.  You can also use the
autocommand |OSAppearanceChanged| to be notified when the OS changes its
appearance.

							*macvim-full-screen*
MacVim can be used in full screen mode, see 'fullscreen'.

There are two types of full screen modes.  By default, MacVim uses macOS'
native full screen functionality, which creates a separate space in Mission
Control.

MacVim also provides a non-native full screen mode, which can be set by
disabling native full screen in the settings panel (see |MMNativeFullScreen|).
Use 'fuoptions' to configure the background color and whether to maximize the
rows/columns.  If you have a MacBook with a camera housing ("notch") at the
top of the screen, you can set |MMNonNativeFullScreenShowMenu| to `NO` and
|MMNonNativeFullScreenSafeAreaBehavior| to 1 to utilitize the whole screen
(this will cause some of the content to be obscured by the notch).

==============================================================================
5. Special colors					*macvim-colors*

The colors in MacVim are defined in two dictionaries inside the "Resources"
folder of the application bundle (MacVim.app/Contents/Resources).  It is
possible to add more colors by modifying these files.  Color names are case
insensitive when accessed from Vim, but in the dictionary they must be
lowercase.

							*SystemColors.plist*
There are only a few system colors that can be accessed from Vim.  These
colors are defined in the dictionary "SystemColors.plist".  This dictionary
stores (key, value) pairs where the key is the name of the color and the
value is an NSColor selector name.

The most useful system colors are: >
	MacSelectedTextBackgroundColor
	MacSecondarySelectedColor
The former is the "Highlight Color" which can be changed in the "Appearance"
section of the System Settings.  The latter is the selection color used by
a Cocoa application when it is not in focus.

							*Colors.plist*
Apart from the system colors, it is also possible to use the standard X11
color names (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names) which usually
come in a file called "rgb.txt".  MacVim does not have such a file, instead it
keeps these colors in a dictionary called "Colors.plist". The key in this
dictionary is the name of the color and the value is an RGB value on the form
#rrggbb stored as an integer.

							*macvim-colorscheme*
MacVim ships with a custom color scheme that is used instead of the default
Vim color scheme.  The color scheme can be changed with >
	:colorscheme macvim
If you prefer a dark background color, then type >
	:set bg=dark
after having loaded the "macvim" color scheme.

Use the |:colorscheme| command if you want to use another color scheme.  Note
that if you want to set syntax highlight colors manually, then you must either
create your own color scheme or add the line >
	let macvim_skip_colorscheme=1
to your ~/.vimrc (~/.gvimrc will not work).  Otherwise the "macvim" color
scheme will be loaded when the system gvimrc file is sourced and mess up your
changes.

The color scheme uses the system "Highlight Color", which can be changed in
the "Appearance" pane of the System Settings.  It also changes the
highlight color when a window becomes inactive.

==============================================================================
6. Menus						*macvim-menus*

Default Menus ~

See |macvim-default-menus|.

Icons ~

Unlike regular Vim, MacVim menus can be customized with an icon.  Simply use
the "icon=" parameter similar to toolbar. See |macvim-toolbar-icon| for usage.

Customization ~

Menus in macOS behave slightly different from other platforms.  For that
reason two new commands have been added to Vim.  To understand what these
commands do you must first understand how menus work on macOS.

Each entry in a menu is called a "menu item".  With each menu item is
associated: a title, a key equivalent and an action message.  When a menu is
displayed the title is shown on the left and the key equivalent (if any) is
shown on the right.  Key equivalents enable you to access a menu item using
the keyboard instead of having to use the mouse.  When a menu item is clicked
it will send its associated action message.  Actions can be used to instruct
MacVim to paste some text (paste:), open a new window (newWindow:), etc.
Certain actions are standard throughout macOS which is why MacVim must be able
to set these for each menu item.  (E.g. the menu item "Edit.Paste" must be
bound to the action "paste:" otherwise pasting won't work in dialogs since
that is the action that instructs them to paste something.)

Menus are configured using the |:macmenu| command and the |:macaction| command
can be used to send action messages.

						*E9001-M* *:maca* *:macaction*
:maca[ction] {action:}	Send the message "action:" to the first responder in
			MacVim.  The list of allowed actions can be seen by
			typing >
			    :maca <C-d>
<			An attempt to send an action not listed here will
			result in an error.  See |macvim-actions| below.

						*:macm* *:macmenu*
:macm[enu] {menu} {key}={arg} ...
			Set Mac specific properties for {menu}.  The
			properties that can be set are:
			    action	the action this menu sends
			    alt		"yes" if alternate of previous menu
			    key		the key equivalent of this menu
			This command must be used in a startup file, for
			example in "~/.gvimrc".  It has no effect otherwise.

			For convenience, a menu with "action=name:" which is
			bound to <Nop> will act as if bound to
			":maca name:<CR>".  Thus, if "Menu.Item" is given by >
			    :an Menu.Item <Nop>
			    :macm Menu.Item action=name:
<			then ":emenu Menu.Item" is equivalent to
			":maca name:".

			The key equivalent is specified with the <D-..>
			syntax.  This is case-sensitive, so <D-a> means Cmd-a
			whereas <D-A> means Cmd-Shift-a.
			Note that key equivalents must contain the Cmd
			modifier flag (<D-..>), and they take precedence over
			normal mappings.
			Use the syntax "key=<nop>" to clear the key equivalent
			of a menu.  This can be used to free up a key
			combination that is set in the system gvimrc so that
			it may be mapped to using ":map".

			Recognised values of "alt" are "0", "no", "1", and
			"yes".  The default is "no".  An alternate menu must
			have the same key equivalent as the previous menu,
			except the modifier flags must differ.  The alternate
			menu is by default hidden and only shows up when the
			modifier is held down.

Here are some examples on how to use these commands:

1. Create a menu item with title "New Window" under the "File" menu, with key
equivalent Cmd-n, which opens a new window when selected: >
	:an 10.290 File.New\ Window <Nop>
	:macm File.New\ Window action=newWindow: key=<D-n>
2. Change the key equivalent to cycle through tabs to Cmd-Left/Right: >
	:macm Window.Previous\ Tab  key=<D-Left>
	:macm Window.Next\ Tab	    key=<D-Right>
3. Create a mapping in normal mode which closes the current tab/window: >
	:map <C-w> :maca performClose:<CR>
4. Free up Cmd-t and remap it to open a file browser in a split view: >
	macm File.New\ Tab key=<nop>
	nmap <D-t> :sp .<CR>
Note: These two lines must be added to .gvimrc else the first line will fail.
The second line is case sensitive, so <D-T> (Cmd-Shift-t) is not the same as
<D-t> (Cmd-t)!

The default menus are set up in "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim".  Take a look at that
file for more examples on how to set up menus.  Note: When no window is open a
minimal default menu is used.  The default menu is set up in MainMenu.nib
which resides in "Resources/English.lproj/" folder inside the app bundle.

						*Actions.plist* *macvim-actions*
Some actions (e.g. changing the font size) are not directly Vim related, and
are handled by MacVim on the application level for the GUI.  MacVim allows
these actions to be invoked by either directly calling |:macaction| or binding
to a menu via |:macmenu|. The full list of actions can be found in the file
"Actions.plist" (under MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/), but below are the
common ones which might be useful.

Hint: The |:macaction| command supports command-line completion so you can
enter ":maca<Space><C-d>" to see a list of all available actions.

Action				Description ~
fileOpen:			Show "File Open" dialog
findNext:			Search forward using the "Find Pasteboard"
findPrevious:			Search backward using the "Find Pasteboard"
useSelectionForFind:		Search the selected text and share to "Find
				Pasteboard"
fontSizeDown:			Decrease font size
fontSizeUp:			Increase font size
hide:				Hide MacVim
miniaturizeAll:			Minimize all windows to the dock
newWindow:			Open a new (empty) window
orderFrontCharacterPalette:	Show the the "Special Characters" dialog
orderFrontFontPanel:		Show the Font panel
orderFrontPreferencePanel:	Show the Settings panel
performMiniaturize:		Minimize window to the dock
performZoom:			Zoom window (same as clicking the green blob)
terminate:			Quit MacVim
zoomAll:			Zoom all windows
zoomLeft:			Pin the window to the left of the screen
zoomRight:			Pin the window to the right of the screen
_cycleWindows:			Select next window (similar to <D-`>)
_cycleWindowsBackwards:		Select previous window (similar to <D-S-`>)
_removeWindowFromStageManagerSet  Remove window from a Stage Manager Set. Same
				as the "Remove Window from Set" menu item.
joinAllStageManagerSets		Window will float among all Stage Manager sets
unjoinAllStageManagerSets	Window will only show up in its own set

==============================================================================
7. Toolbar						*macvim-toolbar*

The toolbar in MacVim works just like in the other GUIs (see |gui-toolbar|),
with the addition of two separator items (see |menu-separator|).  You can use
them as follows: >
	:an ToolBar.-space1-        <Nop>
	:an ToolBar.-flexspace2-    <Nop>
The first example creates an empty space on the toolbar, the second creates an
empty space which will shink or expand so that the items to the right of it
are right-aligned.  A space (flexspace) will be created for any toolbar item
whose name begins with "-space" ("-flexspace") and ends with "-"

							*macvim-toolbar-icon*
In regular Vim, the "icon=" argument (see |toolbar-icon|) can be used to
specify an image file by file path.  In MacVim, the argument could also be
used for specifying an SF symbol or a macOS system image.  Simply use the SF
symbol name or the system image name and MacVim will use load them instead of
an image file.  Below are examples for using an SF symbol "gearshape.2" and a
macOS system image named "NSAdvanced": >
	:an icon=gearshape.2 ToolBar.Setting1   <Nop>
	:an icon=NSAdvanced  ToolBar.Setting2   <Nop>
Some SF symbols in macOS can be customized with different styles.  You can do
so by using colon-delimited options (most of them require macOS 13 Ventura).
The available options are `monochrome`, `hierarchical`, `palette`,
`multicolor`, and `variable-0.5` (where 0.5 can be substituted with any number
between 0 and 1). Download Apple's SF Symbols app to find out what the symbol
names are and what styling options each one supports.  Some examples below: >
	:an icon=bolt.circle:hierarchical       ToolBar.Bolt  :echo '⚡️'<CR>
	:an icon=cloud.sun.rain.fill:multicolor ToolBar.Cloud :echo '🌦️'<CR>
	:an icon=homekit:variable-0.4:palette   ToolBar.Home  :echo '🏠'<CR>
<
If your icon image is a template image (meaning that it is a grayscale image
designed to be mapped to whatever foreground color is), you can add
`:template` to the end of an image name, which will mark it as a template
image to macOS: >
	:an icon=/a/b/black-and-white.png:template ToolBar.Foo <Nop>
<
Supported image formats depend on the version of macOS.  Safe formats include
png, icns, ico.  Later macOS versions also support heic and webp.

Toolbar icons should be of dimension 32x32 or 24x24 pixels.  The larger size
is used when 'tbis' is "medium" or "large", otherwise the smaller size is used
(which is the default).  If the icon file only contains one dimension then
macOS will scale the icon to the appropriate dimension if necessary.  To avoid
this, use a file format which supports multiple resolutions (such as icns) and
provide both 32x32 and 24x24 versions of the icon.

==============================================================================
8. Touch Bar						*macvim-touchbar*

Touch Bar in MacVim is configurable, and works similar to the toolbar (see
|macvim-toolbar|).  The difference is that you use the special menu "TouchBar"
instead of "ToolBar": >
	:an TouchBar.Hello          :echo "Hello"<CR>
<
This feature only works on Mac devices that come with Touch Bars. On the ones
that don't, nothing will show up.

You can also create submenus. Due to macOS restrictions, submenus can only be
one level deep: >
	:an TouchBar.Navigate.Next  :next<CR>
	:an TouchBar.Navigate.Prev  :prev<CR>
<
						*macvim-touchbar-separator*
The separators work similar to how toolbars work: >
	:an TouchBar.-Sep-          <Nop>
	:an TouchBar.-space1-       <Nop>
	:an TouchBar.-flexspace2-   <Nop>
<
The first example is a Vim separator (see |menu-separator|) and injects a
space between two buttons. The second creates a smaller space than a normal
separator and are specified by names that begin with "-space" and ends with
"-". The third creates a flexible empty space which will shrink or expand so
that items after it will be right-aligned, and is specified by names that
begin with "-flexspace" and ends with "-".

						*macvim-touchbar-icon*
You can specify icons for Touch Bar buttons the same way as toolbar icons,
including using SF Symbols (see |macvim-toolbar-icon|).  When a button has an
icon, it won't show the menu name.  Touch Bar icons should ideally be 36x36
pixels, and no larger than 44x44 pixels. >
	:an icon=/home/foo/bar.png          TouchBar.DoThing  :echo 'Do'<CR>
	:an icon=gearshape.2                TouchBar.Setting  <Nop>
macOS also comes with a few default template images designed for use with
Touch Bar.  Some examples: >
	:an icon=NSTouchBarListViewTemplate TouchBar.ShowList :ls<CR>
	:an icon=NSTouchBarRefreshTemplate  TouchBar.Refresh  :e!<CR>
<
						*macvim-touchbar-title*
By default, the Touch Bar buttons will use the menu names as the title. If an
icon is specified, the title will not be shown. You can override this by using
|tmenu| to set a tooltip. The tooltip will be displayed as the title of the
button. If an icon is specified, the tooltip override will be shown alongside
the icon. Example: >
	:an icon=NSTouchBarAddTemplate TouchBar.AddItem <Nop>
	:tmenu TouchBar.AddItem Add an Item
<
			*macvim-touchbar-characterpicker* *macvim-touchbar-emoji*
You can also insert emojis by adding a character picker button (specified by
using a name that begin wtih "-characterpicker" and ends with "-"): >
	:inoremenu TouchBar.-characterpicker-	<Nop>
<
						*macvim-touchbar-defaults*
Here is a list of default Touch Bar buttons that MacVim sets up:

						*macvim-touchbar-fullscreen*
					*g:macvim_default_touchbar_fullscreen*
EnterFullScreen		Touch Bar buttons that allow you to toggle
ExitFullScreen		|'fullscreen'| mode. To disable, add the following to
			your vimrc file: >
			  let g:macvim_default_touchbar_fullscreen=0
<
				*g:macvim_default_touchbar_characterpicker*
-characterpicker-	Character picker that lets you add special characters
			and emojis in insert and terminal modes. To disable,
			add the following to your vimrc file: >
			  let g:macvim_default_touchbar_characterpicker=0
<
==============================================================================
9. Looking up data					*macvim-lookup*

In macOS, you can look up the definition of the text under your cursor by
pressing Ctrl-Cmd-D, or using the trackpad (either three-finger tap or Force
click, depending on your system settings).  This also works in MacVim.
Interesting data such as URL will behave differently (e.g. show a preview of
the web page linked to by the URL) as well.  You can also select a piece of
text to look up the entirety of the phrase (e.g. if you select "ice cream"
using visual mode, then the definition will use that instead of just "ice" or
"cream").  There is also a right-click menu item "Look Up" available when in
visual mode to do the same thing.

If you would like to programmatically access this feature, you can call
|showdefinition()| to show the definition of whatever text you would like to.
MacVim also provides two convenient functions that you can call or map to a
key (they use |showdefinition()| internally):

`macvim#ShowDefinitionUnderCursor()`	Shows the definition of the word under
					the current cursor.

`macvim#ShowDefinitionSelected()`	Shows the definition of the last
					selected text in visual mode.

==============================================================================
10. Dialogs						*macvim-dialogs*

Dialogs can be controlled with the keyboard in two ways.  By default each
button in a dialog is bound to a key.  The button that is highlighted by blue
is bound to Enter, any button with the title "Cancel" is bound to Escape, and
any button with the title "Don't Save" is bound to <D-d>.  Other buttons are
usually bound to the first letter in the title of the button.  There is no
visual feedback to indicate which letter a button is bound to, so sometimes
some experimentation might be required in order to figure out which key to
press.

The second way of controlling dialogs with the keyboard is to enable "Full
keyboard access" in the "Keyboard" pane of the System Settings (you can
also toggle this on or off by pressing Ctrl-F7).  Once keyboard access is
enabled it is possible to move between buttons with Tab and pressing Space to
select the current button.  The current button is indicated with a blue
outline.

==============================================================================
11. System services					*macvim-services*

MacVim provides two system services.  These can be accessed from the MacVim
submenu in the Services menu or by right-clicking a selection.  For services
to work, MacVim.app should be located in the /Applications folder.  (You might
have to logout and then login again before macOS detects the MacVim services.)

These are the currently supported services:
* `New MacVim Buffer With Selection`: Create a new buffer and paste the
  currently selected text.
* `New MacVim Buffer Here`: Create a new buffer and set the current
  directory to the file or folder that is selected in the Finder.

The services respect the "Open files from applications" setting in the general
settings.

For the other direction, within MacVim, you can access system services
associated with selected texts (e.g. opening a URL, converting between
Traditional/Simplified Chinese, do a web search) by selecting them in visual
mode and opening the "Services" submenu either by right-clicking on the text,
or the top-level "MacVim" menu.

==============================================================================
12. mvim:// URL handler				*mvim://* *macvim-url-handler*

MacVim supports a custom URL handler for "mvim://" URLs. The handler is
supposed to be compatible to TextMate's URL scheme as documented at:
	https://macromates.com/blog/2007/the-textmate-url-scheme/

Currently, this means that the format is >
	mvim://open?<arguments>
where "arguments" can be:
	* url — the actual file to open (i.e. a file://... URL), if you leave
		out this argument, the frontmost document is implied
	* line — line number to go to (one based)
	* column — column number to go to (one based)

For example, the link >
	mvim://open?url=file:///etc/profile&line=20
will open the file /etc/profile on line 20 when clicked in a web browser.

Note: A caveat in MacVim's implementation is that it expects special
characters to be encoded twice. For example, a space should be encoded into
"%2520" instead of "%20". A file "/tmp/file name?.txt" would need the
following link: >
	mvim://open?url=file:///tmp/file%2520name%253F.txt
<
MacVim will try to be smart and detect cases where a user has erroneously only
encoded once, but for best results use double-encoding as described above.

Note that url has to be a file:// url pointing to an existing local file.

==============================================================================
13. Keyboard shortcuts					*macvim-shortcuts*

Most keyboard shortcuts in MacVim are bound to menu items and can be
discovered by looking through the menus (see |macvim-menus| on how to create
your own menu shortcuts, see |cmd-key| on how to map your own commands to
Cmd-key shortcuts).  The remaining shortcuts are listed here:

							*Cmd-.* *<D-.>*
Cmd-.			Interrupt Vim.  Unlike Ctrl-C which is sent as normal
			keyboard input (and hence has to be received and then
			interpreted) this sends a SIGINT signal to the Vim
			process.  Use this shortcut if the Vim process appears
			to have locked up and is not responding to key presses.
			This Cmd-key combination cannot be unmapped.

							*Cmd-`* *<D-`>*
Cmd-`			Cycle to the next window.  On an American keyboard the
			key "`" is located under the Esc-key.  On European
			keyboards this key is often adjacent to the left
			Shift-key and it may be not even be marked with "`".
			This Cmd-key combination can only be unmapped via the
			"Keyboard" System Settings.

							*Cmd-Left*  *<D-Left>*
Cmd-Left		Move cursor to the beginning of the line
			(see |cmd-movement|).

							*Cmd-Right* *<D-Right>*
Cmd-Right		Move cursor to the end of the line (see |cmd-movement|).

							*Cmd-Up*    *<D-Up>*
Cmd-Up			Move cursor to the first line (see |cmd-movement|).

							*Cmd-Down*  *<D-Down>*
Cmd-Down		Move cursor to the last line (see |cmd-movement|).

							*Alt-Left*  *<M-Left>*
Alt-Left		Move cursor to the beginning of the previous word
			(see |alt-movement|).

							*Alt-Right* *<M-Right>*
Alt-Right		Move cursor to the beginning of the next word
			(see |alt-movement|).

							*Alt-Up*    *<M-Up>*
Alt-Up			Move cursor one paragraph forward (see |alt-movement|).

							*Alt-Down*  *<M-Down>*
Alt-Down		Move cursor to the previous paragraph
			(see |alt-movement|).

						*cmd-movement* *alt-movement*
The above mappings involving Cmd/Alt + arrow key are enabled by default in the
system gvimrc file "$VIM/gvimrc".  You can quickly disable all of these by
adding the following lines to your "~/.vimrc" (not .gvimrc) file: >
	if has("gui_macvim")
	  let macvim_skip_cmd_opt_movement = 1
	endif
Note: These are the only key mappings that MacVim makes (not counting menu key
equivalents which are not set up with :map).

See |macvim-shift-movement| if you want Shift to select text when used in
conjunction with the above Cmd/Alt movement shortcuts.

						*cmd-key* *cmd-shortcuts*
Creating key mappings that involve the Cmd key (<D-..> in Vim notation) can
sometimes be slightly involved.  Here are all the things you need to consider:

- Make sure the shortcut is not used by a menu item by looking through the
  menus.  If it is then you need to unbind it before you can map to it.  This
  is described under the help for the |:macmenu| command.
- Bindings to <D-..> are case sensitive: <D-d> is not the same as <D-D>.  If
  you want to map something to Cmd+Shift+d, then you need to use <D-D>, not
  <D-S-d> or <D-S-D>.
- Some command key shortcuts are reserved by macOS and cannot be mapped to
  (e.g. <D-Tab>).  However, some of these shortcuts can be freed up in the
  System Settings under Keyboard (e.g. Cmd+Space).
- A few command key mappings are set up by MacVim, see |cmd-movement|.

==============================================================================
14. Trackpad gestures					*macvim-gestures*

MacVim supports trackpad swipe gestures.  By default this can be used to
navigate back/forward in the help (try it!).

Each gesture generates one of the following Vim pseudo keys:

						 *<SwipeLeft>* *<SwipeRight>*
	Generated when swiping three fingers across the trackpad in a
	horizontal direction.  The Apple Magic Mouse generates these
	events when swiping two fingers in a horizontal direction.

						 *<SwipeUp>*   *<SwipeDown>*
	Generated when swiping three fingers across the trackpad in a
	vertical direction.  (Not supported by the Apple Magic Mouse)

						 *<ForceClick>*
	Generated when doing a Force click by pressing hard on a trackpad.
	(Only supported on trackpads that support Force Touch)

	If you have configured to use Force click for "Look up & data
	detectors" in the system settings, by default MacVim will do a
	dictionary lookup instead of triggering this mapping. You can turn
	this off in MacVim's Settings pane, or directly set
	|MMAllowForceClickLookUp|.

You can map these keys like with any other key using the |:map| family of
commands.  For example, the following commands map left/right swipe to change
to the previous/next tab in normal mode: >

	nmap <SwipeLeft> gT
	nmap <SwipeRight> gt
<
As another example, here is how to switch buffers by swiping left/right: >

	nmap <SwipeLeft> :bN<CR>
	nmap <SwipeRight> :bn<CR>
<
See the section on |key-mapping| for more help on how to map keys.

==============================================================================
15. International			*macvim-international* *macvim-multilang*

Typing text ~

When editing non-English text it may be convenient to keep separate keyboard
layouts for normal and insert mode.  This is supported via the 'imd' option on
macOS 10.5 or later (on 10.4 the 'imd' option support is not as useful as it
only switches between Roman and non-Roman input sources and it has been known
not to work very reliably).

For example: When 'noimd' is enabled (i.e. IM is enabled) the input source is
saved when toggling between normal and insert mode, so you can use a US layout
in normal mode then switch to insert mode and choose a Swedish layout.  When
you go back to normal mode the US layout will be selected and when you enter
insert mode the Swedish layout is selected.  This also works when searching
for text etc. see 'imc', 'imi', 'ims'.

Note that the layout used in normal mode is the layout used when 'noimd' is
set (i.e when IM is enabled).  If you find that MacVim switches to the
wrong layout when going back to normal mode, then select the layout you want
to use in normal mode and type ":set imd" followed by ":set noimd".

Translations ~

MacVim uses localized Vim messages (see |multilang-messages|) and menus (see
|multilang-menus|).  However, some of the user interface in MacVim (e.g.
Settings pane) are not yet localized.  There are also some MacVim-specific
messages/menus in Vim that are not currently localized.  Please file an issue
if you would like to see certain messages localized.

==============================================================================
16. Known bugs/missing features				*macvim-todo*

This list is by no means exhaustive, it only enumerates some of the more
prominent bugs/missing features.

- |modifyOtherKeys| support.  This feature allows for more granular key
  mapping (e.g. differentiating <C-I> and <Tab>) and isn't supported by the
  MacVim GUI yet.
- Some parts of MacVim GUI and MacVim-specific messages in Vim are not
  localized yet.
- Sometimes multibyte characters look "too wide", i.e. they overlap the
  following character.  It might help to change 'ambiwidth', or override the
  automatic font substitution by setting 'guifontwide' manually.
- Built-in printing.  |:hardcopy| / <D-p> creates a PDF file which is then
  opened in Preview where it may be printed.  See |pexpr-option|.

17. Hints						*macvim-hints*

In this section some general (not necessarily MacVim specific) hints are
given.

Scenario: ~
You would like to remap Caps Lock to Esc.
Solution: ~
Go to System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts… → Modifier Keys, and
map Caps Lock Key to Escape.

Scenario: ~
You try opening a bunch of files in tabs but not all files get opened in their
own tab.
Solution: ~
To get around this, set 'tabpagemax' to something big in your .gvimrc file
(e.g. ":set tabpagemax=100").

Scenario: ~
You want to open a file in a tab in an already opened window, but typing "mvim
filename" in Terminal opens it up in a separate window.
Solution: ~
Use the |--remote-tab| switch.  If you have several windows open you might
have to specify which window you want the file to open in by using the
|--servername| switch.  The title of a window usually ends in something like
"VIM" or "VIM3" --- this is the server name of that window.  So to open a file
named "foobar.txt" in a window whose title ends in "VIM3" you would type (the
order of the arguments matters): >
	mvim --servername VIM3 --remote-tab foobar.txt
For more information, consult the |client-server| manual page.

Scenario: ~
You like to be able to select text by holding down shift and pressing the
arrow keys and find the Vim way of selecting text strange.
Solution: ~
See |macvim-shift-movement|.

Scenario: ~
You do not want MacVim to set up any key mappings.
Solution: ~
See |cmd-movement|.

Scenario: ~
When you click the (green) full screen button you want the window to maximize
instead of going full screen. You would also like it to maximize both
horizontally and vertically.
Solution: ~
Hole down Option, and the full screen button will become the zoom button,
which will by default only maximize vertically.
To maximize in both directions, hold down Cmd and click the zoom button.  If
you prefer this to be the default action, then set the user default MMZoomBoth
(see |macvim-prefs|).

Scenario: ~
Typing feels sluggish when the cursor is just before a right bracket (i.e.
')', '}', or ']').
Solution: ~
Disable the "matchparen" plugin (see |matchparen|) by typing :NoMatchParen.
If that helps, then you can permanently disable "matchparen" by adding the
following line to your "~/.vimrc": >
	let loaded_matchparen=1
<
Scenario: ~
You want to use MacVim as an editor for some external application.
Solution: ~
If the external application lets you set a program to execute then something
like "mvim -f" might be all you need (the "-f" switch ensures that the "mvim"
script returns only after you close the editor window, otherwise "mvim"
returns immediately). If the external program honors the EDITOR environment
variable (e.g Git does this) then you may get away by adding the following
line to your "~/.profile": >
	export EDITOR='mvim -f'
If you have not installed the "mvim" script in your path you can provide the
path to the Vim binary instead.  Thus, if "MacVim.app" resides in the
Applications folder then you would use the following line: >
	export EDITOR='/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim -g -f'
<
Scenario: ~
You have set MacVim to open from an external program and when you finish
editing (by closing the MacVim window) you want the external program to regain
focus.
Solution: ~
Use the VimLeave autocommand to hide MacVim when the window closes: >
	au VimLeave * maca hide:
Assuming your external program has a setting for which command to execute to
bring up an editor, you would set that option to something like: >
	mvim -f -c "au VimLeave * maca hide:"
(See the above Scenario for an explanation of the "-f" switch.)

Scenario: ~
You have problems creating custom mappings involving the Cmd key.
Solution: ~
To bind to a key involving Cmd you use the "<D-..>" syntax.  Many Cmd-key
mappings are already used by the menus so if your mapping doesn't work then
the solution is usually to first unmap the menu binding (see |macvim-menus|,
in particular read the end of that section).  Also see the section on
|macvim-shortcuts| for some Cmd-key combinations which are not used by the
menus but still need to be freed up before they can be used in custom bindings.

Scenario: ~
You can't find the information on MacVim you thought should be in this manual
page.
Solution: ~
Post your question on the |vim_mac| mailing list or file an issue at
https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/issues.
